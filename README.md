## Behind the Idea!

This project can help people look for locations more efficiently and elegantly. With a responsive User Interface it can be viewed on every screen size including, phones and tablets. Usually its not really interesting to look for information online. Most of the time we `search` for the location on our default _web browser_ and see images and photos here and there. The images and reviews which are present online are scattered everywhere, ranging from hilariously exception to low-key biased reviews. You may find a totally irrelevant image lingering around or someone writing a whole essay on why the place is good or bad.

This website offers to ease the location searching by presenting an adorable UI with accurate information all composed at one place. It is powered by your reviews and your images, along with beautiful graphs to visualize the visitors currently visiting or have visited. Henceforth the name "Geo Visualizer".
